# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-k-nearest-neighbors

This is a machine learning problem solved for a Heart Failure prediction task on kaggle . The task involved building a model which could help to predict whether a person could possibly face the risk of a heart failure. This task involved understanding the data, exploring several features, selecting the best features, creating the model and evaluating its performance. The task involved the use of supervised learning methods since the target labels were provided. The supervised learning technique used for creating the model was the K nearest neighbor classifier.

The model able to achieve an accuracy score of 93.3% along with a ROC_AUC score of close to 96%.

For the purpose of solving the task, the data provided for completing the task had been used. The link to the task and data has been given below -
